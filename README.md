The proposed project is to develop a personalized home automation system that offers customized solutions to meet the unique needs of its users. The system combines hardware components with software features to create an automated system that can be easily tailored for each user.

The system includes a web-based user interface that enables users to customize their home environment, such as temperature, lighting, security settings, and other preferences. The hardware components of the system include sensors, controllers, and actuators that are linked to the user interface through a wireless network. The sensors and controllers detect changes in the environment and send this data back to the user interface for further processing. The actuators then take action based on this data by performing tasks such as turning.

The system provides energy savings through its efficient use of resources and cost savings due to its low initial investment and long-term affordability. This project aims to reduce energy consumption in homes while providing convenience and personalization for the user.
